PHP 8 TODO Application Website.

This repository is for a login app that is controlled through a website. Its purpose is for learning php8 as it is coded demonstrating learning database connection, registering - logging in - logging out of a TODO application website. Additionally, the course instructor also implimented create, read, update, and delete on the user side but I did not implement this functionality on the user side because you would not ever see additioanl create and delete options aside from registration and account deletion within that user and also allowing create and delete of other users from one specified user. This TODO website will also show a TODO application that can function on a simple level as well as be advanced with additional features not learned in the original learning course.
